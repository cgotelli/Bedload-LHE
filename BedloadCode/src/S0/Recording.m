%% Recording function
% This function is meant to start and stop the recording process. The stop signal should be automatically
% triggered after a time or a fixed number of frames. However, for now I'm only using
% the command window to execute "stop(vid)" and stop the video acquisition manually. 
% The stop part can be implemented in the future, maybe. The key is in using the timer function for that.

function Recording(vid)


start(vid);         % Starts the camera


end
