% This function should be able to stop the video after a fixed and given time. However, for now I'm only using
% the command window to execute "stop(vid)" and stop the video acquisition manually. 
% For future development, maybe. The key is in using the timer function for that.

function Recording(vid)


start(vid);         % Starts the camera


end
